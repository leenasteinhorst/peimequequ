                            <p> Hey all! So I have a really old tablet pc, an ASUS ep 121 or eee slate, running windows 7 64 bit os, with previously installed Wacom Feel Drivers on it. My stylus got stolen, so I had to get a more modern one (went with the Samsung Tab S4 pen) and updated my drivers along with this fix: https://www.deviantart.com/epic-33/art/Asus-EEE-Slate-pressure-sensitivity-fix-526569067 (https://www.deviantart.com/epic-33/art/Asus-EEE-Slate-pressure-sensitivity-fix-526569067) so that it would respond. 
From its blazing Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Max-Q graphics to its 144Hz full-HD show with 3-millisecond response time to its 6,600rpm cooling fans, every little thing concerning the Acer Predator Triton 500 is quick. The Triton 500 can also be fantastically compact to get a 15.6-inch gaming laptop. It weighs four.6 pounds (2.1 kg) and chargeur lenovo adl45wcg (https://www.pochargeur.com/original-adaptateur-chargeur-pour-adl45wcg-5a10h43628-lenovo-40mm-17mm-45w-p-88869.html) Hello, I am using an old tablet PC, an Asus EP 121, with windows 7 64 bit operating system, that uses an EMR wacom pen tablet display (wacom Feel drivers I do believe) amp#x200B; I got a newer pen for it, (Tab 4 s pen) since my wacom feel pen got stolen) and had to install some driver fixes https://www.deviantart.com/epic-33/art/Asus-EEE-Slate-pressure-sensitivity-fix-526569067 (https://www.deviantart.com/epic-33/art/Asus-EEE-Slate-pressure-sensitivity-fix-526569067) to get the tablet Over the last couple many years,we have found the netbook occur and go,and we have viewed the rise with the iPad,Android tablets and Google's ChromeBooks.The market for Windows-based items is declining.ChromeBooks are performing the most hurt into the sales of affordable Home windows based PCs while in the west.Microsoft inside the final 12 months has designed several amends to its Windows business model and it has been in damage control manner.Asus,the corporation that started out the netbook. The Lenovo Yoga 730 can be a superior get for students and these of you who have to have a effectively balanced laptop for both operate and occasional entertaining. It really is a properly built 2-in-1 laptop with simple style lines and lightweight building, contemporary hardware and pretty fantastic functionality and battery life, even though it sacrifices on each to some extent as a way to keep transportable and chargeur asus exa1208eh (https://www.pochargeur.com/original-adaptateur-charge. i had the same problem back in 2011 with an asus eee pc and i never managed to solved it , in the end i figured it's because there is no official drivers from the manufacturer. Now i did a fresh instal of 18.04 on a E8400 ,P5Q-PRO,4gb ddr2 800mhz ,radeon 5750 512mb that used to run youtube on windows 10 without a problem the only thing that's different is i changed the hard drive from a 7200rpm to a 5400 rpm and the screen from a 1240 x 1024 to a 42"1080p sony bravia television. My quest. Networking 'issue'. Two PCs, testing using speedtest.net, getting different results using the same ethernet cable (swapping cable between the PCs to test).  PC # 1 PC #2 --- ----- ----- Motherboard Asus Z170 Pro Gaming Gigabyte GA-Z77X-D3H CPU i7 6700k i5 3570k NIC Intel I219-v Qualcomm Atheros AR8161/8165 Speedtest result 250-280Mbps 400-420Mbps I am unable to figure out why the i7 pc, which is more recent, is almost 50% slower in speedtests. We have an old ASUS EEE PC AMD C60 powered netbook that is painfully slow but my daughter is attached to it and would love to give it a second life as a web browser / Youube / Netflix viewer. It is currently running Windows 10 and while it works everything is painfully slow to start. If Windows is doing anything in the background the little two core processor hits 100% usage and gets overwhelmed. Worst of all any time there is a Windows update (even security updates) the machine become unusab. 
Solution: While it is sad that I had to do it, I bought another Tablet. It seems driver support for none Wacom tablets is very spotty in Linux, and thus, I bought a Wacom One. If you want to use a tablet on Linux, a Wacom tablet will work out of the box, most likely perfectly. Other tablets would either need tinkering, or simply won't work. gt gt Hello, I am not sure if this is the correct place, so I'll be thankful for any correction as to which sub/forum I should I'm having an odd issue with my new 2440UQ laptop. I'm kinda certain it has something to do with the graphics drivers, but I'm posting here on the off chance that some of you may have seen something like this before too. Basically, I have flickering, but only on an application-specific level. Simplenote, or Notepad++ for example, I'm in it, typing away, and suddenly the text stops updating on the screen while I'm typing. Maybe two seconds go by, the application window flashes to black Item Description Price --- --- ---- ~~ Apple MacBook MB881LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop ( ~~The Macbook shows quite a bit of wear.

Come da titolo, devo formattare il PC di mia madre, è un EeePC della Asus, adesso come adesso monta Windows 7 Starter. Non sono in possesso del suo CD, e per ragioni economiche e di minor sbattimento pensavo di metterci Linux Mint, ma ho dei dubbi in quanto mia madre non sa utilizzare minimamente il PC ed ho paura di incasinarla.lei sa solo navigare, non sa farci altro. Ora, io ho formattato solo un vecchio PC anni fa, e tramite cd, qui agisco alla stessa maniera ma mettendo l'SO su penna. Hi guys I have this malware infection on all my machines both running Windows and Linux. I have for a while been getting weird entries in the Rootkit/Malware tab in Gmer. I have also noticed some strange executables running among processes all described as Windows services but you could easily see that those executables didn't belong to a clean Windows 7 install or Windows 8.1 install. Windows update is acting strange. I get noticed about updates and can download and install I have an ASUS Eee PC 1215N that I was hoping to upgrade to Windows 10, but after several days attempting to get the upgrade box, I finally got it to show up, but then it says: "Unfortunately, this PC is unable to run Windows 10." And off to the side, it states the compatibility issue is due to the Nvidia ION chip not being supported. According to Nvidia, they do support the ION, but when I attempt to install the drivers with their installer (341.44), it says my card isn't supported. Looking. Okay, so I have an ASUS Eee PC 1201PN and I've been trying to find a Linux distribution that would run as smoothly as possible on it. I've tried Mint and LMDE (I really fancy Mint), and then I tried Debian and then Arch through Evo/Lution. And I am surprised to say that each of these options fell short to Windows XP Black Edition when it comes to smoothness in things like web browsing with 10+ tabs open, or watching a YouTube video. It just outperformed them somehow. Note that I'm rather Total budget and country of purchase: 0-0 (USD) per laptop/netbook, purchasing in USA. Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply. Battery life is important, but so is processor. Our previous computers (see below) failed on both counts. How important is weight to you? Not important, but width is -- the narrow dimension must be less than about 22 cm (~8.6") in order. Title. My sister is using Asus Eee Pc Netbook and it is working on Windows Xp sp3. It started to lag and I recommended installing linux on it but I don't know which distro should I install. Also a good driver support is needed, so count that in, too. specs: dual core 1.6ghz, 1gb ram, 320gb HDD, intel hd 3150. or use this link instead http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/Eee_PC_1011PX/. 
Hello, first up: pardon for my english. I'm a german potato and my english is kinda rusty. After some Years I decided to buid a new PC. After copying all Files and setting up Win10 I ran into a couple of issues I could solve by myself. However 1 Problem drives me nuts. After a couple of Minutes (something between 20m and 30m) the Ethernet Adapter disconnects and instantly reconnects  Before I do an RMA I want to make sure that this is not a Softwareissue and I'm running out of Ideas right. I've had an Asus Eee 1005HA netbook for the last 3 years and its beginning to reach the end of its life - I've had to replace the HDD with an SSD after it died, replaced the battery and replaced the memory (and upgraded it to 2GB). I've been looking into buying a new netbook at Christmas and I'd planned to go for one with a dual-core atom processor, N2600 or N2800 (both Cedar Trail processors) but during my research I found that many people have issues with the graphics, due to them having. So I recently took a netbook that I have had for a couple of years now, an Asus 1015pn ( a 2 gig stick of ram instead of 1 gig), and installed Linux Mint 15 on it from a flash drive. I did a clean install, completely wiping over the existing windows partition and leaving it at the default options besides turning on hard drive encryption. I let it manage it's own partitions and didn't try to mess with anything else. Hi! I need help. I have an old notebook "Network 6200AT", powered by Windows 98. I have many photos on it (1GB HDD, ~300MB of photos), and I want to get them out of it. It has a CD-ROM, not working. It has an IrDA port, not working (it worked a month ago, though) It has a floppy disk drive, not working. It has three PCMCIA slots, and I have two ethernet cards, but no drivers on the computer. EDIT: Years ago I had a similar Xircom card and I used it with this computer Hey reddit, I've been using this site for over 7 years now (this is a throwaway), and my wife for 3, but I need to ask for some help. On Monday the 9th, my wife left her laptop in our cab from Logan airport back home. It was late, dark, and it was a careless mistake. We've tried calling the cab company, but there's not much we can do without the cab number or driver's ID, which we didn't get. I've already put in a call to the main Hackney Carriage Unit to their lost and found I recently installed windows 10 onto my asus eee pc 1025c (https://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Eee_PC_1025C/specifications/) and am unable to adjust my screen resolution. From what I can gather windows installed the microsoft basic display adapter drivers and windows 10 drivers are unavailable for my system. What kind of options do I have? I don't necessarily need a great resolution, I would just like it to fit my monitor's aspect ratio. If it helps (http://speccy.piriform.com/results/2yRHQyG.
